This directory contains Curuxa IDE projects for developing and testing examples for Main Boards and Modules.

They are intended only for Curuxa developers.

Once these examples are finished, they are copied to trunk/CuruxaIDE/Examples (so final users can use them from Curuxa IDE) and some of them are also published on the website.
